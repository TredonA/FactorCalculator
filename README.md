# FactorCalculator
Creating a program where, given an integer input, the factors of the integer will be printed out.

<b>GOAL</b>

Define a function that creates a list of all the numbers that are factors of the user's number. 
For example, if the function is called factor, factor(36) should return [1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36]. 
The numbers in your list should be from least to greatest, and 1 and the original number should be included.
